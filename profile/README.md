# WAVES – Wrist Algorithms: Verification, Evaluation, and Surveillance

## Information

WAVES is an information group of researchers working on two objectives: 

1. To evaluate available wrist-worn algorithms to estimate core physical behavior metrics: steps, sedentary time, moderate-vigorous physical activity. We will use Phase III Verification protocols (i.e., real-world conditions, established reference measure, sample independent from method development, diverse range of participants, appropriate statistical evaluation). 

2. To conduct initial field-based analysis using already collected data that can be collated. These data will help to inform the potential algorithms for use. 

This work is in initial stages. If you are interested in participating please submit an issue so we can be in touch with you. Please watch the Github repo for updates and more information once it becomes available.
